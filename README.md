### The Free Energy Principle: A Brief Overview

This blog series explores the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its role in consciousness, emotion, and brain function. The FEP suggests that the brain minimizes surprise by making predictions based on internal models, using Bayesian inference to optimize perception and action. The Bayesian Brain Hypothesis extends this framework, proposing the brain operates as a probabilistic prediction machine. Emotional valence is understood as changes in free energy, where positive emotions correspond to decreasing uncertainty. Consciousness emerges through hierarchical processing, with the self functioning as a generative model that minimizes prediction errors. Theories including Global Workspace, Integrated World Modeling, and Self-Modeling Theory demonstrate how the brain constructs subjective experience. The series addresses the hard problem of consciousness, highlighting the contribution of affective and subcortical processes to awareness. The series continues with posts examining how alterations in free energy minimization relate to psychopathology. Follow-up discussions explore connections between FEP and anxiety, where heightened prediction error may drive excessive worry and vigilance, depression, involving disrupted predictive models and altered reward processing, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), where differences in sensory prediction and social modeling may account for core features of the condition. These applications show how FEP provides a framework for understanding both typical brain function and the mechanisms underlying mental health conditions.
