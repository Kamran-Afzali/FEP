### The Free Energy Principle: A Brief Overview

This blog series explores the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its role in consciousness, emotion, and brain function. The FEP posits that the brain minimizes surprise by making predictions based on internal models, integrating Bayesian inference to optimize perception and action. The Bayesian Brain Hypothesis extends this idea, suggesting the brain functions as a probabilistic prediction machine. Emotional valence is framed as changes in free energy, where positive emotions reflect decreasing uncertainty. Consciousness is examined through hierarchical processing, with the self emerging as a generative model minimizing prediction errors. Theories such as Global Workspace, Integrated World Modeling, and Self-Modeling Theory illustrate how the brain constructs subjective experience. The series concludes by addressing the hard problem of consciousness, emphasizing the role of affective and subcortical processes in shaping awareness.
